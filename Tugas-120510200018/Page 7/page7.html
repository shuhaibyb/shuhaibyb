        <h3>A. Static</h3>
        <div class="static">static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</div>

        <h3>B. Relative</h3>
        <div class="relative1">relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</div>
        <div class="relative2">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</div>

        <h3>C. Absolute</h3>
        <div class="relative">
            This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
            <p class="absolute">This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.</p>
        </div>
